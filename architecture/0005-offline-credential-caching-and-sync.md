BusinessImpact: >-
  - Enables reliable credential and DID operations in low-connectivity or offline environments
  - Improves user experience and trust by ensuring access to credentials at all times
  - Supports resilience and sovereignty for creators in bandwidth-constrained regions
Runbook: |
  1. Check local cache status: `./scripts/check-credential-cache.sh`
  2. Sync credentials with remote: `./scripts/sync-credentials.sh`
  3. Export cached credentials: `./scripts/export-credential-cache.sh {format}`
  4. Import credentials to cache: `./scripts/import-credential-cache.sh {file}`
  5. Monitor cache health: `./scripts/monitor-cache-health.sh`

## Context

Many creators and users operate in environments with intermittent or no internet connectivity. ov-id-sdk must provide robust offline support for credential and DID operations, including caching, local storage, and eventual synchronization. This ensures users retain access to their credentials and can perform critical operations even when offline.

## Requirements

### Must
- Cache all issued and received credentials locally
- Allow credential verification and presentation offline
- Support local DID resolution and key operations
- Provide manual and automatic sync with remote sources
- Ensure cache integrity and prevent data loss

### Should
- Support selective sync and cache purging
- Provide cache export/import for backup and migration
- Enable cache encryption for privacy
- Track cache health and sync status

### Could
- Support peer-to-peer credential sync
- Enable background sync scheduling
- Provide cache usage analytics
- Integrate with decentralized storage (e.g., IPFS)

## Decision

### 1. Caching Strategy
- **Local-first**: All credentials and DIDs are cached locally by default
- **Sync-on-demand**: Users can trigger sync with remote sources manually or on schedule
- **Integrity checks**: Use hashes and signatures to verify cache integrity
- **Selective sync**: Users can choose which credentials to sync or purge
- **Encrypted cache**: All cached data is encrypted at rest

### 2. Implementation Approach

#### Core Caching Interface
```typescript
interface CredentialCache {
  addCredential(credential: VerifiableCredential): Promise<void>;
  getCredential(id: string): Promise<VerifiableCredential | null>;
  listCredentials(filter?: CacheFilter): Promise<VerifiableCredential[]>;
  removeCredential(id: string): Promise<void>;
  exportCache(format: 'json' | 'csv'): Promise<string>;
  importCache(data: string, format: 'json' | 'csv'): Promise<void>;
  syncWithRemote(options?: SyncOptions): Promise<SyncResult>;
  getCacheStatus(): Promise<CacheStatus>;
}

interface CacheFilter {
  type?: string;
  issuer?: string;
  validOnly?: boolean;
  dateRange?: { from: string; to: string };
}

interface SyncOptions {
  remoteUrl?: string;
  credentialsToSync?: string[];
  direction: 'push' | 'pull' | 'bidirectional';
  schedule?: string; // cron or interval
}

interface SyncResult {
  synced: number;
  conflicts: number;
  errors: string[];
  lastSync: string;
}

interface CacheStatus {
  totalCredentials: number;
  lastSync: string;
  health: 'ok' | 'warning' | 'error';
  issues?: string[];
}
```

#### DID and Key Caching
- Cache resolved DID documents and key material for offline resolution
- Provide local key operations (sign, verify) without network access
- Sync DID updates when online

#### Sync and Conflict Resolution
- Use timestamps and hashes to detect conflicts
- Provide user prompts or automatic resolution strategies
- Log all sync operations for auditability

#### Security and Privacy
- Encrypt all cached data at rest
- Require authentication to access cache
- Allow users to wipe cache securely

### 3. User Experience

#### Offline Operations
- Issue, verify, and present credentials without internet
- Resolve DIDs and perform key operations locally
- View cache status and last sync time

#### Sync Experience
- Manual sync button in CLI or UI
- Automatic sync on network reconnect (optional)
- Conflict notifications and resolution options

#### Backup and Migration
- Export cache for backup or device migration
- Import cache on new device

## Consequences

### Positives
- **Resilience**: Users can operate reliably in any connectivity scenario
- **User Sovereignty**: Full control over credential and DID data
- **Security**: Encrypted cache protects sensitive data
- **Performance**: Local operations are fast and reliable

### Negatives
- **Complexity**: Cache management and sync logic add development overhead
- **Storage**: Local cache increases device storage requirements
- **Conflict Handling**: Sync conflicts may require user intervention

### Trade-offs
- **Resilience vs Simplicity**: Offline support adds complexity but is essential for global accessibility
- **Security vs Usability**: Encryption and authentication may add friction but are necessary for privacy

## Business Impact
- **Required for MVP**: Ensures SDK is usable in all environments
- **Competitive Advantage**: Offline-first design differentiates ov-id-sdk
- **User Trust**: Reliable access to credentials builds user trust and adoption

## Mission Alignment & Principle Coverage
- **Creator First, Always**: Empowers creators to work anywhere, anytime
- **User Sovereignty**: Users own and control their data, even offline
- **Proof-First Trust**: Local verification ensures trust without network dependency
- **Inclusive Integration**: Works for all users, regardless of connectivity
- **Community Collaboration**: Open cache formats and sync protocols
- **Empowerment Over Extraction**: No forced cloud lock-in or subscriptions
- **Privacy by Design**: Encrypted, user-controlled cache
- **Modular & Open-Source Foundation**: Pluggable cache and sync modules
- **Security First**: Encrypted storage and authenticated access
- **Resilience by Design**: Designed for real-world, bandwidth-constrained scenarios
