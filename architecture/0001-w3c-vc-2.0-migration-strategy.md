## Context

The W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 specification was released as the new standard, superseding VC 1.1. The new specification introduces significant improvements including enhanced security features, better data integrity protection, simplified JSON-LD handling, and improved interoperability. ov-id-sdk currently uses VC 1.1 across all credential operations and needs to migrate to VC 2.0 to ensure future compatibility and security.

## Requirements

### Must
- Migrate all new credential issuance to VC 2.0 format within 6 months
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing VC 1.1 credentials during transition
- Support dual validation (VC 1.1 and VC 2.0) during migration period
- Update all credential schemas to VC 2.0 compliance
- Ensure interoperability with VC 2.0 ecosystem partners

### Should
- Provide automated migration tools for existing VC 1.1 credentials
- Update developer documentation and SDKs for VC 2.0
- Implement enhanced security features available in VC 2.0
- Support new proof types and cryptographic suites
- Optimize performance with VC 2.0 improvements

### Could
- Implement advanced VC 2.0 features like selective disclosure
- Support experimental proof types for future compatibility
- Provide VC format conversion APIs for external integrators
- Enable VC 2.0 schema validation in CI/CD pipelines

## Decision

### 1. Adoption Strategy
- **Phased Migration**: Implement VC 2.0 support alongside existing VC 1.1 systems
- **Dual Format Support**: Support both VC 1.1 and VC 2.0 during 12-month transition period
- **New Issuance Default**: All new credentials issued in VC 2.0 format starting Q2 2025
- **Legacy Support**: Maintain VC 1.1 validation for existing credentials with clear sunset timeline
- **SDK Updates**: Update ov-id-sdk to support VC 2.0 as primary format

### 2. Key VC 2.0 Changes Adopted
- **Data Integrity Proofs**: Replace JSON Web Signatures with Data Integrity proof format
- **Enhanced @context Handling**: Simplified JSON-LD context processing
- **Improved Security**: Support for newer cryptographic suites and proof types
- **Better Validation**: Enhanced credential validation with clearer error messages
- **Standardized Formats**: Align with W3C Candidate Recommendation specifications

### 3. Implementation Details

#### Credential Structure Migration
```typescript
// VC 1.1 (Legacy)
interface VC11Credential {
  "@context": string[];
  id: string;
  type: string[];
  issuer: string | IssuerObject;
  issuanceDate: string;
  credentialSubject: CredentialSubject;
  proof: JWSProof;
}

// VC 2.0 (Target)
interface VC20Credential {
  "@context": string[];
  id: string;
  type: string[];
  issuer: string | IssuerObject;
  validFrom: string;
  credentialSubject: CredentialSubject;
  proof: DataIntegrityProof;
}

interface DataIntegrityProof {
  type: "DataIntegrityProof";
  cryptosuite: string; // e.g., "eddsa-jcs-2022"
  created: string;
  verificationMethod: string;
  proofPurpose: "assertionMethod";
  proofValue: string;
}
```

#### Migration Workflow
```typescript
interface VCMigrationAPI {
  // Migration utilities
  migrateCredentialToVC20(vc11: VC11Credential): Promise<VC20Credential>;
  validateCredentialFormat(credential: unknown): Promise<VCFormatResult>;
  
  // Dual format support
  issueCredential(template: CredentialTemplate, format: 'vc-1.1' | 'vc-2.0'): Promise<VerifiableCredential>;
  validateCredential(credential: VerifiableCredential): Promise<ValidationResult>;
  
  // Batch migration
  migrateBatchCredentials(credentials: VC11Credential[]): Promise<MigrationResult>;
  generateMigrationReport(vaultId: string): Promise<MigrationReport>;
}

interface MigrationResult {
  totalProcessed: number;
  successfulMigrations: number;
  failedMigrations: number;
  errors: MigrationError[];
  estimatedCompletionTime: Date;
}
```

### 4. System Integration Updates

#### Cheqd Integration
- **Update cheqd DID provider calls** to support VC 2.0 credential issuance
- **Migrate DID-Linked Resources** to reference VC 2.0 schemas and contexts
- **Update credential templates** to use VC 2.0 format

#### Schema Registry Updates

- Migrate high-priority credentials (identity, environment, runtime)
- Update external integrations and partner APIs
- Sunset VC 1.1 support with clear deprecation timeline

### 6. Backward Compatibility Strategy
- **Dual Validation**: Support both VC 1.1 and VC 2.0 validation during transition
- **Legacy API Endpoints**: Maintain legacy endpoints with clear deprecation warnings
- **Format Detection**: Automatic detection of credential format for appropriate validation

### 7. Developer Experience
- **Updated Documentation**: Comprehensive VC 2.0 documentation and examples
- **Migration Tools**: CLI tools and scripts for credential migration
- **SDK Support**: Updated SDKs with VC 2.0 as default, VC 1.1 as legacy option
- **Testing Framework**: Enhanced testing tools for VC 2.0 compliance

## Consequences

### Positives
- **Future-Proof Infrastructure**: Adopting current W3C standard ensures long-term compatibility
- **Enhanced Security**: VC 2.0 provides improved cryptographic protection and data integrity
- **Better Interoperability**: Alignment with ecosystem partners using VC 2.0
- **Improved Performance**: VC 2.0 optimizations reduce processing overhead
- **Standards Compliance**: Demonstrates commitment to W3C standards and best practices

### Negatives
- **Migration Complexity**: Dual format support and migration process adds operational overhead
- **Development Effort**: Significant development time required for implementation and testing
- **Temporary System Complexity**: Managing two credential formats during transition period
- **Breaking Changes**: Some VC 1.1 features may not have direct VC 2.0 equivalents

### Trade-offs
- **Standards Compliance vs Implementation Effort**: Accept migration complexity to ensure future compatibility
- **Feature Parity vs Security**: Prioritize VC 2.0 security improvements over maintaining all VC 1.1 features
- **Backward Compatibility vs Performance**: Maintain dual support during transition at cost of system complexity

## Business Impact
- **Required for MVP**: Ensures credential infrastructure remains current with W3C standards
- **Reduces Future Technical Debt**: Early adoption prevents larger migration effort later
- **Improves Security Posture**: Enhanced cryptographic protection for all credentials
- **Enables Partner Integration**: Compatibility with partners adopting VC 2.0
- **Supports Compliance**: Alignment with emerging regulatory requirements for digital credentials

## Mission Alignment & Principle Coverage

### Creator First, Always
The VC 2.0 migration will prioritize **creator outcomes**—seamless credential operations and improved security—validated through iterative **creator feedback** research.

### Community Collaboration
All migration tools and VC 2.0 libraries will be released under an **open source** license and maintain a public roadmap, welcoming **community** contributions.

### Empowerment Over Extraction
VC 2.0 migration features will always be free of **opaque fees**; any advanced features will use **transparent pricing** with **revenue sharing** for ecosystem contributors.

### Privacy by Design
VC 2.0 enhances privacy through improved selective disclosure and data minimization, ensuring **GDPR/CCPA** compliance.

### Modular & Open-Source Foundation
VC 2.0 components are **modular**, published as composable NPM packages enabling integrators to adopt without vendor barriers.

### Security First
Data Integrity Proofs, enhanced cryptographic protection, and continuous security audits uphold a **secure by default** stance.

### Resilience by Design
Offline migration capabilities and retry mechanisms ensure credential operations remain robust during the transition period, exemplifying **resilience by design**.
