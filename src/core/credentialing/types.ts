/**
 * Credentialing Module - Public Types
 * 
 * This file contains public interfaces and types for the credentialing module.
 * Currently, types are defined inline in client.ts, but they may be moved here
 * as the module grows.

// Re-export types from client for now
export type { CredentialClientOptions } from './client'

// Future: Add additional public types here as needed
// export interface CredentialIssuanceOptions { ... }
// export interface CredentialVerificationOptions { ... }
